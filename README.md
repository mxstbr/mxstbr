**Hey, I'm Max! ðŸ‘‹**

I'm the co-founder of [Stellate](https://stellate.co), the GraphQL CDN formerly known as GraphCDN, and am widely known for my open source work: about 1% of all public, crawlable websites use tooling I co-created, styled-components.[<sup style="vertical-align:super;font-size:0.75em">1</sup>](https://twitter.com/mxstbr/status/1336727600996167686?s=20)

I also make [Bedrock](https://bedrock.mxstbr.com), the premium full-stack SaaS boilerplate, and [angel invest](/investing) in early-stage startups that I'm passionate about. Previously, I worked on JavaScript tooling at [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com) and architected a greenfield React app at [GitHub](https://github.com) after they acquired my startup [Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat), the community platform of the future.

If I'm not coding or [tweeting](https://twitter.com/mxstbr), I'm likely brewing coffee on my espresso machine (I'm a huge [specialty coffee geek](https://github.com/mxstbr/ama/issues/46)), climbing in a bouldering gym or skiing around the alps.
