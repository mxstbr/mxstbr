**Hey, I'm Max! ðŸ‘‹**

I'm a JavaScript Engineer from Austria ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹ in love with React and Node. About 1% of all public, crawlable websites use open source tooling I invented, styled-components.[1](https://twitter.com/mxstbr/status/1336727600996167686?s=20)

Previously, I worked on JavaScript tooling at [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com) and architected a greenfield React app at [GitHub](https://github.com) after they acquired my startup [Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat), the community platform of the future.

I also run three products on the side, [Bedrock](https://bedrock.mxstbr.com), [Changefeed](https://changefeed.app) and [Feedback Fish](https://feedback.fish), and angel invest in early-stage startups that I'm passionate about, like [Raycast](https://raycast.com), [Upstash](https://upstash.com), [Outsmartly](https://www.outsmartly.com/) and [others](/investing).

If I'm not coding or [tweeting](https://twitter.com/mxstbr), I'm likely brewing coffee on my espresso machine (I'm a huge [specialty coffee geek](https://github.com/mxstbr/ama/issues/46)), climbing in a bouldering gym or skiing around the alps.
